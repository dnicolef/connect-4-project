### Logic
**Most Basic Filling the Board**
```
let board = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], 
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
];

let count = 6; //number of columns

// position goes from 0 to 6 (1 to 7 in the real world. Each position corresponting to a position in the row)
// playerId can be set to 1 for the first player and 2 for the second player

function play(position, playerId){
  for(let i = 0; i < count; i++){
    // check if the current cell is empty (0 for empty)
    if(board[i][position] == 0){
      // update the current cell to 1 for player 1
      board[i][position] = playerId;
      // clear the row before if we are not on the first row
      if(i !== 0){
        board[i-1][position] = 0;
      }
    }
  }
  return board; 
}

play(6, 1);
play(2, 2);
play(5, 1);
play(2, 2);
play(2, 1);
play(0, 2);
play(0, 1);
play(6, 2);
play(5, 1);
play(2, 2);
play(3, 1);
play(0, 2);
play(3, 1);
play(5, 2);
```
Output
```
=> [ 
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0 ],
  [ 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0 ],
  [ 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2 ],
  [ 2, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 1 ] ]
```
